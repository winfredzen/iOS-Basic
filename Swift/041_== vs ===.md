> First, `==` is the equality operator, which tests that two things are equal for whatever definition of “equal” those things use. For example, `5 == 5` is true because there `==` means an integer comparison, and the same is true for other built-in value types such as strings, booleans, and doubles.

> Things get more complicated when `==` is used with a struct you built, because by default they cannot be compared – you need to make them conform to the `Equatable` protocol.

> 遵循 `Equatable` 协议才可以比较

> In comparison, `===` is the *identity operator*, which checks whether two instances of a class point to the same memory. This is different from equality, because two objects that were created independently using the same values will be considered equal using `==` but not `===` because they are different objects.

> The `===` operator is available only when using classes because structs are designed so they are always uniquely referenced.

>  `===` 比较的是内存地址
